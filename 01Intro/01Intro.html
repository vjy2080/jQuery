    <h1>jQuery</h1>
    <h2>What is jQuery?</h2>
    <p> jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.</p>

    <p> The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.</p>

    <p> jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into
        methods that you can call with a single line of code.</p>


    <p> jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.
    </p>

    <p> The jQuery library contains the following features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML/DOM manipulation</li>
        <li>CSS manipulation</li>
        <li>HTML event methods</li>
        <li>Effects and animations</li>
        <li>AJAX</li>
        <li>Utilities</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why jQuery?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It is incredibly popular, which is to say it has a large community of users and a healthy amount of
            contributors who participate as developers and evangelists.</li>
        <li>It normalizes the differences between web browsers so that you don’t have to.</li>
        <li>It is intentionally a lightweight footprint with a simple yet clever plugin architecture.</li>
        <li>Its repository of plugins is vast and has seen steady growth since jQuery’s release.</li>
        <li>Its API is fully documented, including inline code examples, which in the world of JavaScript libraries is a
            luxury. Heck, any documentation at all was a luxury for years.</li>
        <li>It is friendly, which is to say it provides helpful ways to avoid conflicts with other JavaScript libraries.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advantages:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Wide range of plug-ins. jQuery allows developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library.</li>
        <li>Large development community</li>
        <li>It has a good and comprehensive documentation</li>
        <li>It is a lot more easy to use compared to standard javascript and other javascript libraries.</li>
        <li>JQuery lets users develop Ajax templates with ease, Ajax enables a sleeker interface where actions can be
            performed on pages without requiring the entire page to be reloaded.</li>
        <li>Being Light weight and a powerful chaining capabilities makes jQuery more strong.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>While JQuery has an impressive library in terms of quantity, depending on how much customization you require
            on your website, the functionality may be limited thus using raw javascript may be inevitable in some cases.
        </li>
        <li>The JQuery javascript file is required to run JQuery commands, while the size of this file is relatively
            small (25-100KB depending on the server), it is still a strain on the client computer and maybe your web
            server as well if you intend to host the JQuery script on your own web server.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Syntax</h2>
    <pre>
        $(selector).action()
      </pre>


    <ul>
        <li>jQuery * Selector</li>
        <li>jQuery #id Selector</li>
        <li>JQuery Multiple ID selectors</li>
        <li>jQuery .class Selector</li>
        <li>jQuery multiple classes Selector</li>
        <li>jQuery element Selector</li>
        <li>jQuery multiple elements Selector</li>
        <li>jQuery :first Selector</li>
        <li>jQuery :last Selector</li>
        <li>jQuery :even Selector</li>
        <li>jQuery :odd Selector</li>
        <li>jQuery :first-child Selector</li>
        <li>jQuery :first-of-type Selector</li>
        <li>jQuery :last-child Selector</li>
        <li>jQuery Selectors Complete Reference</li>
    </ul>
